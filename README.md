# Apple Calculator Clone

Technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript 

Developed an Apple Calculator clone using Vanilla JS and CSS. This shows my understanding of Classes, Parameters and Methods and implementing each to carry out a variety of specific actions as well as my ability to create a design that matches a popular and aesthetically pleasing one such as the Apple Calculator.
